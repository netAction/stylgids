# stylgids

Create a Style guide (pattern library) for your web projects in your browser!

Add your CSS files and HTML blocks to the stylgids template file and watch them while you change the CSS.
Good for modular pages and good for testing.


## Demo

Look how it works at [netaction.github.io/stylgids/](http://netaction.github.io/stylgids/). You can even start with this file. Simply your CSS and custom blocks.

You like Twitter Bootstrap? Fine. Start directly with a ready to go HTML:
[netaction.github.io/stylgids/bootstrap.html](http://netaction.github.io/stylgids/bootstrap.html)
(stolen from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com))

You like less? Include [less.js](https://github.com/less/less.js) and watch your style sheet live without any preprocessing or build process.

## Alternatives

f?css is another style guide generator independent from any server process or grunt/node.

Showing HTML code that has to be copied by developers can hardly be maintained later. It might be better for you to put all code blocks into templates. Then you can compose the style guide from real live templates and developers simply pick the template names and parameters from the guide rather than HTML code. [Lonely Planet](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/ui-components/cards) has a great example of that method.
